# Team4-Adjustable_Smoke_Alarm
An embedded system that allows you to turn off a smoke detector in your home using a vocal command. This will allow homeowners to turn off false alarms that are just caused by cooking smoke. A temperature sensor will be used to detect if there is a change in temperature. If there is a change in temperature, the system will proceed to flash.


If the system detects smoke, it will beep and flash. If the user says stop or an aggressive ah, the system will stop beeping but continue to flash. Once the system stops detecting smoke, it goes off and resets. If the temperature increases or it detects smoke for too long, then it'll beep again and has to be manually reset. The system could also send data via WiFi to officials to let them know what is happening in the building. It could also notify the user and admins how often they set off the alarm.
